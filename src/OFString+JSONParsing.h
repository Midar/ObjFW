 * @brief The string interpreted as JSON and parsed as an object.

 * @warning Although not specified by the JSON specification, this can also

 *          assumptions about the object returned by this method if you don't
 *          want your program to terminate due to a message not understood, but
 *          instead check the returned object using @ref isKindOfClass:.
