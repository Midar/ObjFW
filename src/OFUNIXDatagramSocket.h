 *
 * Addresses are of type @ref OFSocketAddress. You can use
 * @ref OFSocketAddressMakeUNIX to create an address or
 * @ref OFSocketAddressUNIXPath to get the socket path.
 *
 * @warning Even though the OFCopying protocol is implemented, it does *not*
 *	    return an independent copy of the socket, but instead retains it.
 *	    This is so that the socket can be used as a key for a dictionary,
 *	    so context can be associated with a socket. Using a socket in more
 *	    than one thread at the same time is not thread-safe, even if copy
 *	    was called to create one "instance" for every thread!
