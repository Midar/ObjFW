/**
 * @class OFUDPSocket OFUDPSocket.h ObjFW/OFUDPSocket.h
 *
 * @brief A class which provides methods to create and use UDP sockets.
 *
 * Addresses are of type @ref OFSocketAddress. You can use the current thread's
 * @ref OFDNSResolver to create an address for a host / port pair,
 * @ref OFSocketAddressString to get the IP address string for an address and
 * @ref OFSocketAddressIPPort to get the port for an address. If you want to
 * compare two addresses, you can use
 * @ref OFSocketAddressEqual and you can use @ref OFSocketAddressHash to get a
 * hash to use in e.g. @ref OFMapTable.
 *
 * @warning Even though the OFCopying protocol is implemented, it does *not*
 *	    return an independent copy of the socket, but instead retains it.
 *	    This is so that the socket can be used as a key for a dictionary,
 *	    so context can be associated with a socket. Using a socket in more
 *	    than one thread at the same time is not thread-safe, even if copy
 *	    was called to create one "instance" for every thread!
