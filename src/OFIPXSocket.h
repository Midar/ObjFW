 * @brief A class which provides methods to create and use IPX sockets.
 *
 * Addresses are of type @ref OFSocketAddress. You can use
 * @ref OFSocketAddressMakeIPX to create an address or
 * @ref OFSocketAddressIPXNetwork to get the IPX network,
 * @ref OFSocketAddressIPXNode to get the IPX node and
 * @ref OFSocketAddressIPXPort to get the port (sometimes also called
 * socket number).
 *
 * @warning Even though the OFCopying protocol is implemented, it does *not*
 *	    return an independent copy of the socket, but instead retains it.
 *	    This is so that the socket can be used as a key for a dictionary,
 *	    so context can be associated with a socket. Using a socket in more
 *	    than one thread at the same time is not thread-safe, even if copy
 *	    was called to create one "instance" for every thread!
