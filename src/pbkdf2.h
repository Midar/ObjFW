 *
 * @param HMAC The HMAC to use to derive a key
 * @param iterations The number of iterations to perform
 * @param salt The salt to derive a key with
 * @param saltLength The length of the salt
 * @param password The password to derive a key from
 * @param passwordLength The length of the password
 * @param key The buffer to write the key to
 * @param keyLength The desired length for the derived key (`key` needs to have
 *		    enough storage)
 * @param allowsSwappableMemory Whether data may be stored in swappable memory
